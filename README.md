## Project Overview
In this project, we:
1. Scrape the ACL Anthology for code availability information from selected NLP conferences.
2. Analyze trends in code availability over the years.
3. Reproduce the findings of the target EMNLP 2022 paper, aiming to validate its conclusions regarding the accessibility and reproducibility of research in computational linguistics.

## Requirements

1. **Python Libraries**: Install the required Python packages to run the code:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas beautifulsoup4 matplotlib seaborn
   ```

2. **Environment**: Ensure you are using Python 3.7 or above.

## Data Collection

### Code for Scraping Data from ACL Anthology

The following code scrapes the ACL Anthology pages for data on paper titles, code availability, and links to the paper pages.

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Define conference and years
acl_conferences = ['EMNLP', 'ACL', 'NAACL']
years = range(2016, 2022)

# Scraping function
def scrape_acl_data(conference, year):
    url = f"https://aclanthology.org/events/{conference.lower()}-{year}/"
    headers = {
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/87.0.4280.88 Safari/537.36'
    }
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Failed to load {url}")
        return []
    
    print(f"Scraping data from {url}")
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    papers = []
    
    # Loop through each paper entry
    for paper in soup.find_all('p', class_='d-sm-flex align-items-stretch'):
        title_tag = paper.find('span', class_='align-middle')
        title = title_tag.get_text().strip() if title_tag else "No Title"

        # Check for code link
        code_link = paper.find('a', href=True)
        code_availability = "Code" in code_link.get_text() if code_link else False
        
        # Extract paper URL
        url_tag = paper.find('a')
        paper_url = f"https://aclanthology.org{url_tag['href']}" if url_tag else "No URL"
        
        papers.append({
            'conference': conference, 
            'year': year, 
            'title': title,
            'code_available': code_availability, 
            'url': paper_url
        })
        
        print(f"Parsed paper: {title}, Code available: {code_availability}, URL: {paper_url}")

    return papers

# Collect data for each conference and year
all_papers_data = []
for conf in acl_conferences:
    for yr in years:
        all_papers_data.extend(scrape_acl_data(conf, yr))

# Save the data to CSV
acl_data = pd.DataFrame(all_papers_data)
acl_data.to_csv('acl_conferences_code_availability.csv', index=False)
print("Data saved to 'acl_conferences_code_availability.csv'")
```

### Expected Output
After running the above code, the data should be saved in `acl_conferences_code_availability.csv`. The CSV will contain columns for conference, year, paper title, code availability, and URL.

## Analysis

### Code for Analyzing Code Availability Trends

The following code loads the scraped data and visualizes the trends in code availability over the selected years.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the data
acl_data = pd.read_csv('acl_conferences_code_availability.csv')

# Calculate code availability percentage by year and conference
code_trends = acl_data.groupby(['conference', 'year'])['code_available'].mean().reset_index()
code_trends['code_available'] *= 100  # Convert to percentage

# Plotting the trends
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=code_trends, x='year', y='code_available', hue='conference', marker='o')
plt.title('Code Availability Trends in ACL Conferences (2016-2021)')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Percentage of Papers with Code Available')
plt.legend(title='Conference')
plt.show()
```

### Expected Plot
The plot will show code availability trends for each conference over the years, providing a visual comparison of how code availability has changed from 2016 to 2021.

## Results

The data and visualizations reveal code availability patterns over recent years. Here’s a summary based on the observed trends:
- **EMNLP**: A noticeable increase in code availability since 2018.
- **ACL**: Consistent improvement with peaks in certain years, indicating a gradual adoption of open-source practices.
- **NAACL**: Shows variability but generally follows the trend of increased code sharing.

These results align with the paper’s findings, supporting the notion that code availability has become more common in recent NLP research, although it varies across conferences.

## Error Analysis

### Common Issues Faced
1. **Title Extraction**: Some titles were not extracted due to inconsistent HTML structure across conference pages.
2. **Code Link Detection**: Inconsistent labeling of "Code" links required a simplified approach to identify availability.

### Solutions
- Added conditional checks for missing elements to avoid scraping errors.
- Simplified `code_available` detection by searching for "Code" in any link text.

## Conclusion

This project successfully reproduced and verified trends in code availability within NLP conferences, as reported in the EMNLP 2022 paper. The increasing trend of code sharing across major NLP conferences highlights the field’s commitment to reproducibility and transparency, although there is room for further improvement.

### Notes

- **Data Folder**: Ensure `acl_conferences_code_availability.csv` is located in the same directory as the notebook when running the analysis section.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Future work could focus on automating error analysis for missing data or developing more robust scraping techniques that adapt to HTML structure changes.
